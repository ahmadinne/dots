# You can also allow a notification to appear even when paused. Notification will appear whenever notification's override_pause_level >= dunst's paused level.
# This can be used to set partial pause modes, where more urgent notifications get through, but less urgent stay paused. To do that, you can override the following in the rules:
# override_pause_level = X

# SCRIPTING
# You can specify a script that gets run when the rule matches by
# setting the "script" option.
# The script will be called as follows:
#   script appname summary body icon urgency
# where urgency can be "LOW", "NORMAL" or "CRITICAL".
#
# NOTE: It might be helpful to run dunst -print in a terminal in order
# to find fitting options for rules.
